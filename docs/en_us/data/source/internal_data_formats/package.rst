For partners who are running courses on edx.org and edge.edx.org, edX regularly
makes research data available for download from the Amazon S3 storage service.
The *data package* that data czars download from Amazon S3 consists of a set of
compressed and encrypted files that contain event logs and database snapshots
for all of their organizations' edx.org and edge.edx.org courses.

.. _Data Package Files:

**********************
Data Package Files
**********************

A data package consists of files that contain event data and database data.

.. note:: All file names include the date in {YYYY}-{MM}-{DD} format.

============
Event Data
============

The ``{org}-{site}-events-{date}.log.gz.gpg`` file contains a daily log of
course events. A separate file is available for courses running on edge.edx.org
(with "edge" for the {site} in the file name) and on edx.org (with "edx" for
{site}).

For a partner organization named UniversityX, these daily files are identified by the organization name, the edX site name, and the date. For example, ``universityx-edge-2014-07-25.log.gz.gpg``.

An alternative option for event data is available. The
``{date}-{org}-tracking.tar`` file is available each week. It contains a
cumulative log of events in all of an organization's courses. Data for courses
running on both the edx.org and edge.edx.org. sites is included in this file.

.. remove this paragraph ^ when weekly file is removed.

For information about the contents of these files, see :ref:`Data Package
Contents`.

==================
Database Data
==================

The ``{org}-{date}.zip`` file contains views on database tables. A new file is
available each week. Database data as of the time of the export, for all of an
organization's courses on both the edx.org and edge.edx.org. sites, is included
in this file.

For a partner organization named UniversityX, each weekly file is identified by
the organization name and its extraction date: for example,
``universityx-2013-10-27.zip``.

For information about the contents of this file, see :ref:`Data Package
Contents`.

.. _Amazon S3 Buckets and Directories:

********************************************
Amazon S3 Buckets and Directories
********************************************

Data package files are located in two different buckets on Amazon S3:

* The **edx-course-data** bucket contains the daily
  ``{org}-{site}-events-{date}.log.gz.gpg`` files of course event data.
  
* The **course-data** bucket contains the weekly ``{date}-{org}-tracking.tar``
  file of cumulative course event data and the weekly ``{org}-{date}.zip``
  database snapshot.

.. revise this paragraph ^ when weekly event file is removed.

For information about accessing Amazon S3, see :ref:`Access Amazon S3`.

.. _Download Data Packages from Amazon S3:

****************************************************************
Download Data Packages from Amazon S3
****************************************************************

#. Connect to Amazon S3 using a third-party tool or the AWS Command Line
   Interface. For information about connecting to Amazon S3, see :ref:`Access
   Amazon S3`.

#. To download daily event files, you navigate to the **edx-course-data**
   bucket, and then through this directory structure to locate the files you
   want to download:

   ``{org}/{site}/events/{year}``

   The event logs in the ``{year}`` directory are in compressed, encrypted
   files named ``{org}-{site}-events-{date}.log.gz.gpg``.

3. Download the ``{org}-{site}-events-{date}.log.gz.gpg`` file.

   If your organization has courses running on both edx.org and edge.edx.org,
   separate log files are available for the "edx" site and the "edge" site.
   Repeat this step to download the file for the other site.

4. To download a database data file, navigate to the edX **course-data**
   bucket. This bucket contains ``{org}-{date}.zip`` files, which are
   available each week. 

#. Download the ``{org}-{date}.zip`` file. 

#. To download a cumulative weekly event file, return to the **course-data**
   bucket. This bucket contains the ``{date}-{org}-tracking.tar`` files, which
   are available each week.

.. remove this step ^ when weekly event logs are no longer available

.. _Data Package Contents:

**********************
Data Package Contents
**********************

After you download your data package files, you must extract and decrypt the
contents. Each of the files you download contains one or more files of research
data.

============================================================
Extracted Contents of ``{org}-{site}-events-{date}.gpg``
============================================================

The ``{org}-{site}-events-{date}.gpg`` file contains event data for a single
day. After you download a ``{org}-{site}-events-{date}.gpg`` file for your
institution, you:

#. Use your private key to decrypt the downloaded .gpg file. See :ref:`Decrypt
   an Encrypted File`.

#. Extract the log file from the compressed .gz file. The result is a single
   file named ``{org}-{site}-events-{date}.log``.

.. remove this section v through the next note when weekly file is removed

============================================================
Extracted Contents of ``{date}-{org}-tracking.tar``
============================================================

The ``{date}-{org}-tracking.tar`` file contains cumulative event data for all
of an organization's courses, running on both edx.org and edge.edx.org.

.. note:: Over time, these files can become very large (25GB and larger). In some environments, problems such as session timeouts can occur when you download them. 

After you download the ``{date}-{org}-tracking.tar`` file for your
institution, you:

#. Extract the contents of the downloaded .tar file. 
   
   To balance the load of traffic to edX courses, every course is served by
   multiple edX servers. When you extract the contents of this file, a separate
   subdirectory is created for events that took place on each edX server.

   For example, subdirectories with these names can be created:

   ``prod-edxapp-003``

   ``prod-edxapp-004``

   ``prod-edxapp-005``

   Each of these directories contains an encrypted log file of event data for
   every day that events occurred on that server. These event tracking data
   files are named ``{date}-{org}.log.gpg``.

#. Use your private key to decrypt the extracted log files. See :ref:`Decrypt
   an Encrypted File`.

.. note:: During analysis, you must combine events from each server to get a complete picture of the activity in each course. 

.. remove this section ^ when weekly file is removed

============================================
Extracted Contents of ``{org}-{date}.zip``
============================================

After you download the ``{org}-{date}.zip`` file for your
institution, you:

#. Extract the contents of the file. When you extract (or unzip) this file, all
   of the files that it contains are placed in the same directory. All of the
   extracted files end in ``.gpg``, which indicates that they are encrypted.

#. Use your private key to decrypt the extracted files. See
   :ref:`Decrypt an Encrypted File`.

The result of extracting and decrypting the ``{org}-{date}.zip`` file is the
following set of sql and mongo database files.

``{org}-{course}-{date}-auth_user-{site}-analytics.sql``

  Information about the users who are authorized to access the course. See
  :ref:`auth_user`.

``{org}-{course}-{date}-auth_userprofile-{site}-analytics.sql``

  Demographic data provided by users during site registration. See
  :ref:`auth_userprofile`.

``{org}-{course}-{date}-certificates_generatedcertificate-{site}-analytics.sql``

  The final grade and certificate status for students (populated after course
  completion). See :ref:`certificates_generatedcertificate`.

``{org}-{course}-{date}-courseware_studentmodule-{site}-analytics.sql``

  The courseware state for each student, with a separate row for each piece of
  course content that the student accesses. No file is produced for courses
  that do not have any records in this table (for example, recently created
  courses). See :ref:`courseware_studentmodule`.

``{org}-{course}-{date}-student_courseenrollment-{site}-analytics.sql``

  The enrollment status and type of enrollment selected by each student in the
  course. See :ref:`student_courseenrollment`.

``{org}-{course}-{date}-user_api_usercoursetag-{site}-analytics.sql``

  Metadata that describes different types of student participation in the
  course. See :ref:`user_api_usercoursetag`.

``{org}-{course}-{date}-user_id_map-{site}-analytics.sql``

   A mapping of user IDs to site-wide obfuscated IDs. See :ref:`user_id_map`.

``{org}-{course}-{date}-{site}.mongo``

  The content and characteristics of course discussion interactions. See
  :ref:`Discussion Forums Data`.

``{org}-{course}-{date}-wiki_article-{site}-analytics.sql``

  Information about the articles added to the course wiki. See
  :ref:`wiki_article`.

``{org}-{course}-{date}-wiki_articlerevision-{site}-analytics.sql``

  Changes and deletions affecting course wiki articles. See
  :ref:`wiki_articlerevision`.
