When you are done :ref:`Setting up your Course Index`, you are ready to build
your course content.

This chapter provides an outline of the steps involved in developing your
course content, with links to more details.

.. _Understanding Course Building Blocks:

************************************
Understanding Course Building Blocks
************************************

Before you begin, you should understand the building blocks of an edX course.
See:

* :ref:`Developing Your Course Outline`
* :ref:`Developing Course Sections`
* :ref:`Developing Course Subsections`
* :ref:`Developing Course Units`
* :ref:`Developing Course Components`

.. _Creating New Course Content:

****************************
Creating New Course Content
****************************

To create new course content, you set up the organization of your courseware,
add the content in the right part of the course, schedule when different parts
of the course are released, and publish content for students.

WORKFLOW DIAGRAM

See:

#. :ref:`Create a Section`
#. :ref:`Create a Subsection`
#. :ref:`Schedule Release Dates`
#. :ref:`Create a Unit`
#. :ref:`Add a Component`


.. _Making Course Content Visible to Students:

******************************************
Making Course Content Visible to Students
******************************************

If and when the content you create is visible to students depends on the
section and subsection release dates, the publishing status of the unit, and
whether content at any level is explicitly hidden from students.

See:

* :ref:`Schedule Release Dates`
* :ref:`Publish Units`
* :ref:`Hide Content From Students`


.. _Revising Content:

****************************
Revising Content
****************************

You can revise your course content at any time. When you reorganize sections and subsections, the new order is immediately visible to students. When you change a unit, or components within a unit, you must publish those changes to make them visible to students.
