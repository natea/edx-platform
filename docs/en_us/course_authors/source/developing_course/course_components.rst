This chapter describes how you develop course components. See:

* `What is a Component?`_
* `Add a Component`_
* `Edit a Component`_
* `Duplicate a Component`_
* `Delete a Component`_

For more information about specific component types, see:

* :ref:`Creating Course Content Index`
* :ref:`Exercises and Tools Index`

********************
What is a Component?
********************

A component is the part of a unit that contains your actual course content. A
unit can contain one or more components.

A student can view the name of all components in a unit by hovering over the
unit in the ribbon at the top of the page.

By default, Studio includes four types of components.

* **Discussion components** provide discussion spaces in the body of your
  course. Students can explore ideas about a lesson with their peers in a
  discussion space.
* **HTML components** allow you to add text, images, and some types of learning
  tools to your course. Content in HTML components is formatted as HTML.
* **Problem components** enable you to add many different types of exercises
  and problems to you course, from simple multiple choice problems to complex
  circuit schematic exercises.
* **Video components** contain the videos that you want to include in your
  course.

.. _Add a Component:

********************

For more information, see the documentation for the specific component type
that you want:

- :ref:`Working with Discussion Components`
- :ref:`Working with HTML Components`
- :ref:`Working with Problem Components`
- :ref:`Working with Video Components`

.. _Edit a Component:

********************
Edit a Component
********************

You can edit a component only if the unit that contains it is Private, or if
you are editing a new draft of the unit. For more information, see :ref:`Public
and Private Units`.

When you can edit the component, the Edit icon and the Display Name appear in
the component header:

.. image:: ../Images/unit-edit.png
  :alt: Image of a unit with Edit icon circled

Click the Edit icon.  Then follow instructions for the type of component you
are editing.

=====================================
Set the Display Name for a Component
=====================================

Each component has a display name that shows in the component header when you
can edit the component. The display name also shows to students when they hover
the mouse pointer over the unit icon in the course accordion.

To set the display name for a component:

#. Edit the component.
#. Click **Settings**.
#. Edit the **Display Name** field.

4. Click **Save**.

Different types of components have different fields in the Settings dialog box,
but all have the **Display Name** field.

.. _Duplicate a Component:

**********************
Duplicate a Component
**********************

You can duplicate a component only if the unit that contains it is Private, or
if you are editing a new draft of the unit. For more information, see
:ref:`Public and Private Units`.

When you duplicate a component, a new copy of that component is added directly
beneath the first component. You can then modify the duplicate. In many cases,
duplicating a component and editing a copy is a faster way to create new
content.

When you can duplicate the component, the Duplicate icon appears in the
component header:

.. image:: ../Images/unit-dup.png
  :alt: Image of a unit with Duplicate icon circled


Click the Duplicate icon.  Then follow instructions for the type of component
you are editing.

.. _Delete a Component:

**********************
Delete a Component
**********************

You can delete a component only if the unit that contains it is Private, or if
you are editing a new draft of the unit. For more information, see :ref:`Public
and Private Units`.

.. note:: Be sure you want to delete the component. You can not undo the
 deletion.

When you can delete the component, the Delete icon appears in the component
header:

.. image:: ../Images/unit-delete.png
  :alt: Image of a unit with Delete icon circled

Click the Delete icon.  Then confirm the deletion.
