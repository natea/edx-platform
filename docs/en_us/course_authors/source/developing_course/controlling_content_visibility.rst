.. _Controlling Content Visibility:

###################################
Controlling Content Visibility
###################################

As course staff, you must carefully control which content is visible to
students and when.

You control content visibility through three features in Studio:

* `Release Dates`_
* `Unit State`_
* `Content Hidden from Students`_
  
 All three features work together to control content visibility.

.. _Release Dates:

***********************
Release Dates
***********************

You schedule release dates for sections and subsections. Published units are
visible to students after those release dates.

Prior to the release date, content in the section or the subsection is not
visible to students.

By default, a subsection inherits the release date of the section it is in,
though you can change it.

See:

* :ref:`Set a Section Release Date`
* :ref:`Set a Subsection Release Date`


.. _Unit State:

***********************
Unit State
***********************

You publish units to make them visible to students.  Students see the last
published version of a unit if the section and subsection it is in are
released.

Students do not see units that have never been published, and they do not see
unpublished changes to units or components within units.

For more information, see :ref:`Unit States`.

.. _Content Hidden from Students:

*****************************
Content Hidden from Students
*****************************

You can hide any content from students, regardless of the content's release
date or published status.

You can set a flag on a section, subsection, or unit to hide that content from
students. All content beneath the level you select is hidden. For example, if
you hide a section from students, all subsections and units within that section
are automatically hidden.

* :ref:`Hide a Section from Students`
* :ref:`Hide a Subsection from Students`
* :ref:`Hide a Unit from Students`
